         Poem by Emily Dickinson
      </a>
   </span>
    <p>
        I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
        Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
        Then there's a pair of us!<br>
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
        How public - like a Frog -<br>
        To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br>
        To an admiring Bog!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <cite>By Emily Dickinson (1891)</cite>
